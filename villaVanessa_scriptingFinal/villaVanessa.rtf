\f0\fs24 \cf0 For my project. i simulated a remote controlled ship. The script is called \'93ship\'94 and located in the Scripts folder.\
When the finger pushes the button down (labeled \'93push\'94 in the outliner), the claws push away from the ship. when the lever is rotated forward or backward, the ship also moves forward or backward.}
